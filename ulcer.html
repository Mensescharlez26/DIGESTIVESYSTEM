        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <span class="p">
          • An ulcer, also known as a gastric ulcer, is an open sore that forms in the lining of the stomach. You can also acquire one in your duodenum, which is the initial portion of your small intestine into which your stomach feeds. Peptic ulcers include both duodenal and stomach ulcers. They're called after the protein peps, a digestive liquid present in the stomach that can sometimes spill into the duodenum. Peptic ulcer disease gets worse with these liquids. A stomach ulcer develops when gastric acid digests away at your stomach's protective lining. Acid causes open sores, which can bleed and cause stomach pain. Peptic ulcer disease shows itself in the form of stomach ulcers. Although they are frequent and curable, they should be handled seriously.

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
  <span class="p"> 
    • Discomfort between meals or during the night (duodenal ulcer)
  </span>
  <span class="p">
Discomfort when you eat or drink (gastric ulcer)
</span>
<span class="p">
  • Stomach pain that wakes you up at night
</span>
<span class="p">
  • Feel full fast
</span>
<span class="p">
  • Bloating, burning, or dull pain in your stomach
</span>
<span class="p">
  • Comes and goes days or weeks at a time
</span>
<span class="p">
  • The discomfort lasts for minutes or hour
</span>
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <span class="p">
          • Ulcers on the stomach or small intestinal lining. Sores on your esophagus (throat) are another possibility. The majority of ulcers occur in the small intestine. These ulcers are referred to as duodenal ulcers. Ulcers in the gut are stomach ulcers. Esophageal ulcers are sores in the throat.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          • This common bacterial illness affects up to half of the worldwide population. It typically inhabits the stomach and intestines. It does not appear to create difficulties for many people. Their gut immune systems keep it under control. However, some of those infected have H. pylori infection. The bacteria continue to grow, producing persistent inflammation and peptic ulcer disease by eating through the stomach lining. H. Pylori infection is linked to around 60% of duodenal ulcers and 40% of stomach ulcers.
        </span>
        <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
        <span class="p">
          • Stomach ulcers are more usual in individuals aged 30 to 50 and exhibit a higher reccurency in males than females. However, they tend  to build up  in women more frequently than in men during later stages of life, typically after the age of 60.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          • Excessive alcohol consumption.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          • Regular usage of a class of widely used pain relief medications such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, advil, or similar nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          • A family history of ulcers.Illness such as liver, kidney or lung disease.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          •Smoking or using tabacco
        </span>
        <h2>Complications</h2>
        <span class="p">
          • The most frequent symptom of an ulcer is stomach pain. Sharp pains commonly occur between the breastbone and the abdominal button. This ache usually occurs a few hours after eating. It can also happen at night or in the early morning when the stomach is empty. Eating anything or using an acid suppressor (antacid) medication can help relieve pain.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          • It can cause additional issues, such as digestive bleeding or a hole in the stomach or duodenal wall, which can make someone very unwell. 
        </span>

        <h2>Prevent</h2>
        <span class="p">
       <span class="p">
        • When you eat, your stomach needs to operate overtime to absorb everything. If you go to bed immediately after eating, your stomach will still be working as time passes, and you may wake up feeling uncomfortable. It's better to avoid going to bed for at least 1 or 2 hours after eating. This allows your stomach to digest the food you've eaten.
     </span>
     <span class="p">
      • Drink 8 glasses of water every day to keep your body hydrated and to avoid dyspepsia. Drink additional fluids in addition to water, such as fruit juices, vegetable juices, and herbal teas. Eat enough fruits and vegetables, which are high in water content and will keep you hydrated.
   </span>
   <h2>Treatment/Care</h2>
   <span class="p">
    All of these treatments are needed to  prescribed by doctors:
  </span>
  <span class="p">
    •Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are usually recommended for a period of 4 to 8 weeks.
  </span>
  <span class="p">
    • The most often prescribed PPIs for stomach ulcer treatment are omeprazole, pantoprazole, and lansoprazole.
  </span>
  <span class="p">
    •Antibiotic medications to kill H. pylori.
  </span>
  <span class="p">
    •Medications that protect the lining of your stomach and small intestine.
  </span>
  <span class="p">
    • Reduce alcohol comsumptions.
  </span>
  <span class="p">
    Home Remedies:
  </span>
