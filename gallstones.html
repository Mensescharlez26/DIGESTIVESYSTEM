        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <span class="p">
          •	A gallstone is a deposit of hardened bile that resembles a pebble that can develop in the gallbladder. Just below your liver on the right side of your abdomen is your gallbladder, a little, pear-shaped organ. Bile, a digestive fluid made in your liver and kept in your gallbladder, is stored in and released by the gallbladder. When you eat, your gallbladder contracts and releases bile into your duodenum, which is part of your small intestine.
        </span>
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <span class="p">
         • Significant abdominal pain in the upper right or middle of the abdomen
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          • Right shoulder or back pain
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          • Vomiting and diarrhea
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          • Fever and Chills
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          • Skin and eye discoloration.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          • Light-colored faeces and Black urine
          </span>
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <span class="p">
          •	There is too much cholesterol in your bile. Normally, the molecules in your bile are sufficient to break down the cholesterol your liver excretes. However, if your liver excretes more cholesterol than your bile can break down, it may crystallize and eventually turn into stones.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          •	There is too much bilirubin in your bile. The chemical bilirubin is created when your body destroys red blood cells. Your liver produces too much bilirubin under some circumstances, such as liver cirrhosis, biliary tract infections, and specific blood diseases. Gallstone development is influenced by the excess bilirubin.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          •	Your gallbladder does not properly drain. Bile may become extremely concentrated if your gallbladder doesn't drain fully or frequently enough, which can lead to the development of gallstones.
        </span>
        <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
        <span class="p">
          •  Gallstones are more common in those over the age of 40.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          • Gallstones are more frequent in females than males.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          • Do gallstones run in your family? If there is a history of them, you are more likely to acquire them yourself.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          • Obesity: Obesity is a substantial risk factor for gallstones.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          • Rapid weight loss: If you lose weight quickly, you are more prone to acquire gallstones.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          • Diet: A low-fiber, high-cholesterol, high-fat diet may increase your risk of gallstones.
        </span>
        <h2>Complications</h2>
        <h3>Common Complications</h3>
        <span class="p">
          •	Gallbladder Attack: An acute, stabbing pain in the upper right abdomen that might continue for several hours.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          •	Biliary colic: A gallstone that temporarily plugs a bile duct can cause biliary colic, a milder form of discomfort. 
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          •	Jaundice: When bile backs up into the blood, it can cause a yellowing of the skin and eyes known as jaundice.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          •	Cholecystitis: A gallbladder inflammation, cholecystitis.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          •	An inflammation of the pancreas is referred to as pancreatitis.
        </span>
        <h3>Less Common Complications</h3>
        <span class="p">
          •	Gallbladder cancer: The gallbladder can get infected with this uncommon kind of cancer.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          •	Bile duct infection: If a gallstone plugs a bile duct and bacteria get into the bile, a bile duct infection, a dangerous condition, can result.
        </span>
        <span class="p">
          •	Gallstone pancreatitis: A gallstone that blocks the pancreatic duct results in this particular type of pancreatitis.
        </span>
       
        <h2>Prevent/Avoid</h2>
        <span class="p">
          •	Avoid skipping meals. Try to eat at the same time every day. Fasting or skipping meals both raise the risk of gallstones.
       </span>
       <span class="p">
        •	Slowly reduce your weight. Slow down if you need to lose weight. Gallstone risk can increase with rapid weight loss. Aim to lose 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) per week.
     </span>
     <span class="p">
      •	Eat more foods high in fiber. Increase your intake of fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
    </span>
    <span class="p">
    •	Keep a healthy weight. Gallstones are more likely to form in people who are overweight and obese. By consuming less calories and engaging in more exercise, you can work toward achieving a healthy weight. Once you reach a healthy weight, attempt to keep it off by sticking to a balanced diet and exercising regularly.
   </span>
   <h2>Treatment/Care </h2>
   <span class="p">
    •	Surgery to remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomy)
  </span>
  <span class="p">
    •	Medications to dissolve gallstones.
  </span>
  <span class="p">
    •	Laparoscopic cholecystectomy
  </span>
  <span class="p">
    •	Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
